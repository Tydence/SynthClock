SynthClock 2021-05-10

This is an Arduino based clock module.

It features 6 outputs for 1x clock time.

Multiplied times of 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x, and 64x exist.
Are the latter ones useful? Or should they be cut? We shall see!

Divided times of /2, /4, /8, /16, /32 are noted in the code.
So, if you wanted a bas every other beat, it would be easily added by plugging bass into the /2 port. A cymbal crash ever 16 beats? Just plug into the /16 port.


The idea is to be able to have a single clock that can control multiple items.
Easy to build, so others can use this simple system.

Ideally, it would be syncable. So you could have multiple machines matching time, for synth jam sessions or just matching other equipment. If this is by wire, or by a small screen displaying the BPM, it would be ideal.

Included is a faceplate for the module.
The numbers are partially covered by the jacks. This is an issue.
Note that it's sized for 1/4in jacks and in the old Moog Modular sizing.


Anyway, share and enjoy! If you can improve the code, go for it!
